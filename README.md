# Second-order Optimization Techniques for Diffusion Noise Optimization

In this repository, we extend the work of [Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11994) by introducing second-order optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of DNO for motion editing tasks.

## Setup

### üöÄ 1. Setup environment 

First, clone this repository. Then, create and activate a conda environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dno
```

### üì• 2. Download dependencies and pretrained models

Let's download the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
bash prepare/download_smpl_files.sh
bash prepare/download_glove.sh
bash prepare/download_t2m_evaluators.sh
```

Next, clone [HumanML3D](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/HumanML3D.git) and copy the data dir to our repository:

```shell
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/EricGuo5513/HumanML3D.git
unzip ./HumanML3D/HumanML3D/texts.zip -d ./HumanML3D/HumanML3D/
cp -r HumanML3D/HumanML3D Diffusion-Noise-Optimization/dataset/HumanML3D
cd Diffusion-Noise-Optimization
```

You're all set! üéâ

## Usage

### üõ§Ô∏è Trajectory Editing
To edit a trajectory of a motion, run one of the following command for the respective optimizer:

```bash
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/trajectory_editing_adam.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/trajectory_editing_lbfgs.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/trajectory_editing_lm.yml
```

The results will be saved in a timestamped subfolder in `save/mdm_avg_dno/trajectory_editing`. They contain a video of the edited motions, log files to run with TensorBoard, and the edited motions in `.npy` format.

### üï∫ Pose Editing
To edit a pose of a motion, run one of the following command for the respective optimizer:

```bash
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/pose_editing_adam.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/pose_editing_lbfgs.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/pose_editing_lm.yml
```

The results will be saved in a timestamped subfolder in `save/mdm_avg_dno/pose_editing`. They contain a video of the edited motions, log files to run with TensorBoard, and the edited motions in `.npy` format.

### ‚ö° Controversial Example
To produce the results for the controversial example discussed in section 4.5 our our report, run the following commands:

```bash
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/controversial_example_adam.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/controversial_example_lbfgs.yml
python -m dno_optimized.generate config/controversial_example_lm.yml
```

The results will be saved in a timestamped subfolder in `save/mdm_avg_dno/controversial_example`. To see the videos have a look at the corresponding subfolders for the tree optimizers in `save/mdm_avg_dno/controversial_example`.
